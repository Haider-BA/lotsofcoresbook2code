This zipfile contains a snapshot of the efindsite Intel Xeon and Intel
Xeon Phi source codes.

The source code for eFindSite can be found at

compilation and installation instructions, as well as a detailed
tutorial on processing large datasets using heterogeneous computing
platforms.

After that change to the efindsite-1.2-phi or efindsite-1.2 directory
and follow the instructions on the efindsite website to build and run
with example datasets available on the website.
