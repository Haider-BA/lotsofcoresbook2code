AMBER is licensed software at the time this book was published.
This may change - please look at the Amber website for more information.
This was the only code used in either the first volume or the second volume of the Pearls books which was not completely freely available.  We choose to include it due to its popularity, and the sense that Amber may eventually choose to be more openly available.  While there is not guarantee of the latter, the former (the popularity of Amber) is true.

The Amber PMEMD code used in the chapter was a licensed code
Only those who have acquired a license can compile and run it.
