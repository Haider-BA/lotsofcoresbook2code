mirror from http://lotsofcores.com book 2, since dropbox isn't good for everyone

I had to do quite a bit of editing to get these files into a github approved state. Everything was ungzipped and untarred. Some of the files were too big and were split. Other than that, I believe everything is as downloaded from http://lotsofcores.com book 2 download, which really is a great book (I have nothing to do with it).
